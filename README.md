# Kiev-to-Kyiv
This is a browser extension that automatically converts the city name of "Kiev" to "Kyiv" on a web page. Ukrainians prefer the latter naming, despite Western familiarity with the former, because of its association with the country's Soviet past and the rendering being more faithful to the Ukrainian language.
