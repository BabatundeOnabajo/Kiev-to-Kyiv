# Kiev-to-Kyiv
This is a browser extension that automatically converts the city name of "Kiev" to "Kyiv" on a web page. Ukrainians prefer the latter naming, despite Western familiarity with the former, because of its association with the country's Soviet past and the rendering being more faithful to the Ukrainian language.

It is made in the Manifest Version 3, and is therefore compliant with the rules of major extension stores such as the Google Web Store (as at 24th October 2022).

It was submitted to the 2022 CivicCode Hackathon under the category **Empowerment**. 

# History

# Technical details
As with all browser extensions, the Kiev to Kyiv browser extension is built in the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as JSON. The browser extension uses regular expressions within the JavaScript language to dynamically change references of "Kiev" to "Kyiv".

How this browser extension works is that it uses "regular expressions", a functionality found in many programming languages and in this particular context JavaScript, to detect where the word "Kiev" appears on a web page. Regular expressions look for certain words, numbers and symbols according to a predefined pattern. Once the word "Kiev" is found, it is then changed to "Kyiv".
