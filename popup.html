    <!-- This is a browser extension called Kiev to Kyiv that was created by Babatunde Onabajo and licensed under the MIT licence and submitted to the 2022 CivicCode hackathon publicised by DevPost under the category of "Empowerment". The Kiev to Kyiv browser extension automatically changes references to "Kiev" in a web page to "Kyiv". Ukrainians prefer the latter spelling because the spelling of "Kiev" reminds Ukrainians of the country's Soviet past. Furthermore, Ukrainians prefer "Kyiv" because it is seen as being more faithful to the Ukrainian language. It is hoped that this extension serves the purpose of being mindful of Ukrainian cultural sensibilities. -->
